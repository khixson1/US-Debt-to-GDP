Using the "US GDP Debt vs Debt.xlsx" downloaded from https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w47-why-americas-debt-doesnt-stop-growing, a parasite plot (a plot with two y-axis to plot) was created to overlay both the US GDP (in billions) with the US Total Public Debt (in trillions).  The data was cleaned to remove missing data and the last row was removed due to being incomplete.
